# Tezos TS Streamer package

`@tezos-ts/streamer` is an npm package that provides developers with methods to subscribe (using a websocket) to data from the Tezos blockchain. It relies on [https://github.com/ecadlabs/tezos-streamer](https://github.com/ecadlabs/tezos-streamer) which offers a websocket API to the caller, and streams data from the blockchain.

See the top-level [https://github.com/ecadlabs/tezos-ts](https://github.com/ecadlabs/tezos-ts) file for details on reporting issues, contributing and versioning.
