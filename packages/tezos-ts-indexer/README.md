# Tezos TS Indexer package

`@tezos-ts/indexer` is an npm package that provides developers with convenient methods to access indexed Tezos blockchain data.

`@tezos-ts/indexer` currently supports the [https://github.com/ecadlabs/tezos-indexer-api][0] API which provides a RESTful API built on top of the [Nomadic Tezos Indexer][1] projects PostgreSQL database.

Support for other back-end indexer APIs may be added in the future, while maintaining the same API surface for the developer.

See the top-level project [https://github.com/ecadlabs/tezos-ts](https://github.com/ecadlabs/tezos-ts) for details on reporting issues, contributing and versioning.
